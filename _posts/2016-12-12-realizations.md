Just a quick comment, I have opinons on how dates should be written, and they're reflected by [this comic][1]. Feel free to disagree, but this is how I'm writing entries into this post.


<h4 class="md-title">2017-1-1 New Years</h4>
  Every year that passes is so trivial in the grand scheme of things, it's ridiculous that people celebrate it at all. The earth alone is monstrously old, and the universe itself (according to current theory) is even older. Much like growing a millimeter higher might not seem like much to a giant sequoia, a single year is nothing in the time frame of the world or history of the human race.

<h4 class="md-title">2016-12-31 Rocks</h4>
I've had a rock collection ever since I was a wee-tot, and although I rarely look at it nowadays, it's cool to think about how many different cool rocks there are. For every rock that I find or notice, there's easily a hundred more that are incredible little boxes of time and nature's strength. Each rock is different, even though they're all rocks.

<h4 class="md-title">2016-12-30 Smoke</h4>
My family hosts a monthly(ish) gathering where people congregate around a firepit and talk for a few hours, and at this one, there was some wind. That alone isn't too remarkable, but when combined with the smoke from the fire and a few well-placed lights shining into the sky, you could see the various movements of the wind. There was turbulence that sent the smoke spinning in circles, and moments where the wind would make it speed upwards, spiraling above the treetops. My description isn't doing it justice, but there was something absolutely mind-boggling about how the wind moved around.

<h4 class="md-title">2016-12-29 Music</h4>
There is a plethora of different music out there. The amount of music itself is impressive, albeit not the most interesting thing (in my opinion). The crazy thing is that for every song that you listen to, the probability is that it took that person at least a few hours to make it. That there's that many people who are willing to dedicate so much of their time to making things that may or may not get ever heard is just amazing. In addition, most people who make music have some sort of understanding of how to make stuff that sounds good. To learn that and to get comfortable using stuff like that is a long endeavour on its own, which is why it's so astonishing that so many people make music.

<h4 class="md-title">2016-12-28 Reflections</h4>
I was in the car on my way to a nearby city at nighttime, simply looking out the window. Crossing over a causeway, I saw all the lights of the city, reflected in the water. It looked like we were flying into a floating city, one that was surrounded by dark clouds and stars, a beacon for all the people outside of it. For each light, it easily took someone a half-hour to wire its power and install the light.

<h4 class="md-title">2016-12-27 Virtual Reality</h4>
Man this stuff is amazing! I got the chance to try some mid-level goggles, it's an amazing experience to suddenly get transported to somewhere completely different. VR is going to let us learn so much more about the world - we'll be able to travel all over, view places (under the sea, above clouds, etc) that we would never be able to be immersed into normally. If you haven't already, go out and make friends with someone who owns a good set. Even for those who get motion sickness, it's a must-try, if not a must-have.

<h4 class="md-title">2016-12-26 Cars</h4>
Cars are weird. I get that a lot of very smart people have worked very hard on making them efficient, but some things are overlooked. Why do they have to be individual property? If every neighborhood or group of houses coordinated to own cars and borrow/lend them to other groups if there's a surplus or decrease in demand of cars, we could both reduce the amount of cars owned by people, along with increasing connections with people near you by interacting and collaborating to figure out car-sharing.

<h4 class="md-title">2016-12-25 Names</h4>
People are all given names. That's just crazy. Every single person you talk to, interact with, or simply glimpse out of the corner of your eye, has been given a name by some other people who have been given names by some other people who have been given names by some other people who have been... It's midboggling to think that we've all got these things, that to ourselves are considered incredibly important, but to others is simply a string of sounds. I'm tempted for a day to go out and ask everyone I see for their names, just to get a slightly better idea of the scope of how many people there are out there..

<h4 class="md-title">2016-12-24 Water</h4>
Water (liquids in general) is an unusual substance. The ease with which it moves around, while also not expanding, is quite unusual. I don't really understand why there's a liquid state of matter, it seems so much more intuitive that there be only solids and gasses, not some intermediate state. I'm sure the question will be resolved by the time I finish all the high-school chemistry classes, but for now, it's a slightly small mystery to me.

<h4 class="md-title">2016-12-23 Magic</h4>
Our eyes and brains are not optimal for our current society. I'm sure they're great when you're getting chased by a tiger or need to follow the trajectory of a rock that someone threw, but when we're trying to watch magic, it's really hard to catch good sleight of hand without being experienced in the realm of cardistry and tricks. We're so easliy tricked by a movement, and we're led to make assumptions that aren't neccesarily true (I saw the ball appear to get put into the man's hand, therefore it must be there). Even when you know there's a trick and are intentionally going out of your way to catch it, you can still be led [astray][2].

<h4 class="md-title">2016-12-22 Dreams</h4>
Lots of people don't realize how cool dreams are. Every night, you can get transported far away, both from your troubles and to a magical world. You don't even need to go out of your way to enjoy them, because it's very difficult to go without sleep. In addition, you can do whatever you want in them without worry of repremandation, as you're the only one in the dream who can access it!. I'm not one of the people who'se been naturally gifted with an ability to lucid dream, but I'm excited to work on developing that aspect of my life, because it'll let me get another hour or two of interesting experiences into my day.

<h4 class="md-title">2016-12-21 Dust Motes</h4>
This is pretty common knowledge, but just sitting back and observing motes of dust is a really fun pasttime. However, not that many people realize how difficult of a condition it is to get them to work. They're a lot more easily visible with a thin beam of light, and if you've got a large window it's a lot harder to get them to appear than with a small and concentrated flashlight or laser beam. I think you can see them better behind a darker surface as well, but I'm not 100% sure.

<h4 class="md-title">2016-12-20 Holograms</h4>
I'd like to thank my father for alerting me to this phenomenon, which was very strange! As the sun was approaching the angles common to sunset, it shined through a window of our house, and reflected on a mirror. When you look at the mirror at just the right angle and moment, for some reason these slight imperfections (or something) pop out to the eye, and give a strange semblance of three-dimensional shapes. It's super cool, and I'm pretty sure it was the dust on the window that was causing the light to break up in such a strange way.

<h4 class="md-title">2016-12-19 Frost</h4>
The frost that covers plants when it's slightly below freezing is amazing. It's like little crystals of glass that are stuck onto all of these intricate leaves, and the sheer fact that it's able to happen so quickly (and dissipate quickly) makes it even more magical feeling. The world doesn't care if you're a large tree or a small blade of grass, it'll give you frost all the same.

<h4 class="md-title">2016-12-18 Polishing</h4>
This weekend I was inspired by my dad to work on a ball of clay, turning it into a pretty good approximation of a sphere, then polishing it till it looked shiny. It's called the art of making dorodango, and they are really fun to make! It's a very meditative process, and I've had a lot of fun working on perfecting my personal clay ball. 

<h4 class="md-title">2016-12-17 Surprise</h4>
I have been hiding money in different back pockets and random places througouht my room, so as I go through my days and forget about them, I can get pleasantly surprised by a five or ten dollar bill popping into my pocket. It's like a little leprechaun is hiding things with the intent of making me happy.

<h4 class="md-title">2016-12-16 Bubbles</h4>
There's a very strange phenomenon when rain sometimes hits puddles, and drops bounce up and ride on the water. It's weird to think that the water somehow bounces up and balances on top of the other water, and doesn't just join into puddles. It happens in showers too, and is often more visible in the better light.

<h4 class="md-title">2016-12-15 Night Lights</h4>
Walking home from robotics, I've been noticing that certain streetlights project different shadows. There's one on my way back from robotics that has trees blocking it, and the little light that shines through the trees (which were glistening with raindrops today as I was passing by) is shaped in these strange grids. Compare that to a street light a few houses down, which presumably is using a different type of bulb - it casts nice round shadows. For some reason this caught my attention, and I'm not really sure of its significance. It's just pretty looking.

<h4 class="md-title">2016-12-14 Noise</h4>
Our brains are absolutely phenomenal at tuning out ambient noise! In a noisy classroom, you can often still hear the person you're paying attention to talk, but if you've ever paused to actually listen to the room without trying to listen to any one thing, you'll be overwhelmed by the wave of sound. It's absolutely insane, that we're able to pick things out of the sea of noise, and I've now come to understand why it's so darn hard to get a good voice-recognition or song-recognition program.

<h4 class="md-title">2016-12-13 Blue</h4>
We rarely look straight up. I often look at clouds and the sky, wondering about them, but it's always at an angle of about sixty degrees from horizontal, never straight up. On a blue sunny day, try this. Look up, and gauge the blueness of the sky. The customary blue sky we've come to know and love is out near the horizon, where we're used to seeing it, but if you look up, you get a much, much darker blue (in the right conditions). It's pretty cool that you can actually see the thickness of the atmosphere and the blue changing based off of the angle of incedence.

<h4 class="md-title">2016-12-12 Acorn Caps</h4>
I was walking to school today and noticed that only the caps of the acorns had fallen to the ground. The acorns themselves had fallen a few months prior (I remember because I tend to pick them up absently while walking and thinking of something), and it never occured to me that they fell without their caps. It looks like the trees (might be specifically the type of tree I was walking past), stage their droppings, so that the acorns fall, then the caps fall later. I'll check it next year.
