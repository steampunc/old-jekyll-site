Gears are phenomenal. The amount of time that it must have taken for tooth design to be optimized to the petal(ish) shape that mesh so well is pretty cool. Of course, that's just a simple gear. There's all these complicated gears that transfer rotation through wonky angles, and the various mechanisms that work to transform rotational motion to linear motion, then pulleys, and all of these different simple machines. For each of those different objects, there must have been someone who spent a good part of their life perfecting it to work as well as most of them do.!
