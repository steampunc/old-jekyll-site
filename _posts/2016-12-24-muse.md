Water (liquids in general) is an unusual substance. The ease with which it moves around, while also not expanding, is quite unusual. I don't really understand why there's a liquid state of matter, it seems so much more intuitive that there be only solids and gasses, not some intermediate state. I'm sure the question will be resolved by the time I finish all the high-school chemistry classes, but for now, it's a slightly small mystery to me.
