I was observing the clouds, and I've been noticing that sometimes they split into lines. Instead of there being coherent cloud blobs, there's sometimes a general shape that's cut through by parallel lines. It only happens to clouds up high in the atmosphere, but it's really weird. Maybe the wind somehow runs just right to split them like that? Or perhaps there's certain bands of lowerly dense air where clouds have trouble existing? Whatever it is, it's very strange, and makes the sky sometimes look like a low-resolution grid of pixels.
