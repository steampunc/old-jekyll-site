I'm not sure how many people perceive this, but there always seems to be numerous different pitches of hums in any place with gridded standard AC electricity. Most places in the world have an AC current at 50 or 60 Hz, and I just recently bothered to look up the closest note that it corresponds to. Apparently, it's about halfway between Bb and B when it's at 60 Hz, and when it's alternating at 50 Hz it's just a shy above a G.
