This weekend I was inspired by my dad to work on a ball of clay, turning it into a pretty good approximation of a sphere, then polishing it till it looked shiny. It's called the art of making dorodango, and they are really fun to make! It's a very meditative process, and I've had a lot of fun working on perfecting my personal clay ball.
