Our brains are absolutely phenomenal at tuning out ambient noise! In a noisy classroom, you can often still hear the person you're paying attention to talk, but if you've ever paused to actually listen to the room without trying to listen to any one thing, you'll be overwhelmed by the wave of sound. It's absolutely insane, that we're able to pick things out of the sea of noise, and I've now come to understand why it's so darn hard to get a good voice-recognition or song-recognition program.
