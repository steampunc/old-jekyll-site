We're really small, but really big too. It's interesting how for us humans to better understand the world we need to quantify most aspects of it, using units that correspond to known and understandable quantities. With everything based on our own frame of reference, we seldom think of the actual size of things. Assuming such things exist (which in all likelihood they don't), imagine a giant whose eye is the size of the earth. We would then be monstrously small in comparison to this enormous object. However, if you imagine something as small as a microbe, we must be considered incredibly large in its nonexistent brain.
