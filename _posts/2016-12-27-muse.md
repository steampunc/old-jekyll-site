Man this stuff is amazing! I got the chance to try some mid-level goggles, it's an amazing experience to suddenly get transported to somewhere completely different. VR is going to let us learn so much more about the world - we'll be able to travel all over, view places (under the sea, above clouds, etc) that we would never be able to be immersed into normally. If you haven't already, go out and make friends with someone who owns a good set. Even for those who get motion sickness, it's a must-try, if not a must-have.
