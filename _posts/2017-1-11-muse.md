There's a lot of cool stuff that happens with numbers. I think a lot of people are turned off from math both due to peer pressure ("Oh gosh this math class sucks" kind of mentalities), and because they fail to see the applications or beautiful things that happen when numbers mesh in cool ways. It happens more frequently in higher division math courses that you start getting the really weird math that applies (like anything that uses limits or infinity), but I think most people don't get the experience of realizing that there are all these fundamental properties that connect numbers and how their relationships are affected by other numbers.
