Does anyone ever wonder how differently other animals perceive the world? Do they have thoughts like we do? What's the definition of a conscious being, and what happens if you follow the chain of brain development from an ant to a human - when do you start considering an animal or thing conscious? I've been having these questions bounce around my head, as I've been thinking about the rate at which computers are progressively getting better at behaving like humans. It's much like evolving brains from an ant brain, in that we'll have to draw the line somewhere to begin considering sufficiently advanced computers as conscious.
