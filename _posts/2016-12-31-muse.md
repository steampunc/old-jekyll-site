I've had a rock collection ever since I was a wee-tot, and although I rarely look at it nowadays, it's cool to think about how many different cool rocks there are. For every rock that I find or notice, there's easily a hundred more that are incredible little boxes of time and nature's strength. Each rock is different, even though they're all rocks.
