Why is it that people decided that certain notes sound good together while others sound bad? It seems kinda arbitrary, but I wonder if the most common forms of music somehow evolved to get to a point that it sounds best to us? If there's some sort of primal connection with certain noises, it would make sense, but I don't know what would have initially caused people to favor that noise.
