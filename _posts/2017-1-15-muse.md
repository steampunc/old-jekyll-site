I played a game with a friend the other day (inspired by the film _Arrival_), where I was a linguist and I was tasked with communicating with an alien species whose language was unknown. The language I worked on deciphering was pictographic, but still had similar concepts and grammar that are common in most human languages, like possession and verbs. I'm far from done working out the current language, but once I get sufficiently skilled in reading and writing in it, I might make a blog post on it. In addition, I've been thinking of ways to make languages that are far from the standard human conventions.
