I was walking to school today and noticed that only the caps of the acorns had fallen to the ground. The acorns themselves had fallen a few months prior (I remember because I tend to pick them up absently while walking and thinking of something), and it never occurred to me that they fell without their caps. It looks like the trees (might be specifically the type of tree I was walking past), stage their droppings, so that the acorns fall, then the caps fall later. I'll check it next year.
