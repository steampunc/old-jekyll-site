I was in the car on my way to a nearby city at nighttime, simply looking out the window. Crossing over a causeway, I saw all the lights of the city, reflected in the water. It looked like we were flying into a floating city, one that was surrounded by dark clouds and stars, a beacon for all the people outside of it. For each light, it easily took someone a half-hour to wire its power and install the light.
