There's a lot of different trees, and a lot of people make leaf collections that display all the different leaves, which are pretty by themselves. Why don't people make branch collections? They're just as unique in how the differ between trees, and they look cool too! They are indeed harder to store and manage, but they warrant attention too. They also tell more about the tree itself, as you can look at the tree's wood and bark colors along with its general long-term health by observing the branches.
