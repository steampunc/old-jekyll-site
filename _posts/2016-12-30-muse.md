My family hosts a monthly(ish) gathering where people congregate around a fire pit and talk for a few hours, and at this one, there was some wind. That alone isn't too remarkable, but when combined with the smoke from the fire and a few well-placed lights shining into the sky, you could see the various movements of the wind. There was turbulence that sent the smoke spinning in circles, and moments where the wind would make it speed upwards, spiraling above the treetops. My description isn't doing it justice, but there was something absolutely mind-boggling about how the wind moved around.
