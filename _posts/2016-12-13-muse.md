We rarely look straight up. I often look at clouds and the sky, wondering about them, but it's always at an angle of about sixty degrees from horizontal, never straight up. On a blue sunny day, try this. Look up, and gauge the blueness of the sky. The customary blue sky we've come to know and love is out near the horizon, where we're used to seeing it, but if you look up, you get a much, much darker blue (in the right conditions). It's pretty cool that you can actually see the thickness of the atmosphere and the blue changing based off of the angle of incidence.
