Our eyes and brains are not optimal for our current society. I'm sure they're great when you're getting chased by a tiger or need to follow the trajectory of a rock that someone threw, but when we're trying to watch magic, it's really hard to catch good sleight of hand without being experienced in the realm of cardistry and tricks. We're so easily tricked by a movement, and we're led to make assumptions that aren't necessarily true (I saw the ball appear to get put into the man's hand, therefore it must be there). Even when you know there's a trick and are intentionally going out of your way to catch it, you can still be led [astray][1].
