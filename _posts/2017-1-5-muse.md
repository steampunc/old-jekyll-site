What if it's possible the only reason people believe older appliances were built better is because the only ones that have survived were well-built? I know that's what's generally said ("Oh, that's an old appliance, they don't seem to break down as much as the new ones."), but if the only ones that survived were because they were consistent, it might mean that most products from the past were just as shoddily made as they are today, and just like today, there's some appliances that might end up outlasting most of us, and thus our current newer appliances might be considered better built than those of the future.
