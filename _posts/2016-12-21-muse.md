This is pretty common knowledge, but just sitting back and observing motes of dust is a really fun past time. However, not that many people realize how difficult of a condition it is to get them to work. They're a lot more easily visible with a thin beam of light, and if you've got a large window it's a lot harder to get them to appear than with a small and concentrated flashlight or laser beam. I think you can see them better behind a darker surface as well, but I'm not 100% sure.
