Every year that passes is so trivial in the grand scheme of things, it's ridiculous that people celebrate it at all. The earth alone is monstrously old, and the universe itself (according to current theory) is even older. Much like growing a millimeter higher might not seem like much to a giant sequoia, a single year is nothing in the time frame of the world or history of the human race.
