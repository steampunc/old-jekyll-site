I'd like to thank my father for alerting me to this phenomenon, which was very strange! As the sun was approaching the angles common to sunset, it shined through a window of our house, and reflected on a mirror. When you look at the mirror at just the right angle and moment, for some reason these slight imperfections (or something) pop out to the eye, and give a strange semblance of three-dimensional shapes. It's super cool, and I'm pretty sure it was the dust on the window that was causing the light to break up in such a strange way.
