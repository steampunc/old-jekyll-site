All that we produce will eventually break down. True, some things take a decidedly longer time, but eventually everything will disappear. Look at the trees, producing all these leaves, which just fall to the ground and turn into dirt, and all the animals, leaving waste and droppings everywhere. The factories, constantly cranking out more and more stuff, that, regardless of if it makes it to a landfill, will eventually break down. Much like all these things, we are all eventually going to turn into dirt and minerals as well.
