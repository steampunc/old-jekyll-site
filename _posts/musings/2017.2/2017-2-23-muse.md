What keeps us separate from everything else in the universe? Why does it seem that we are separate "entities" existing? We definitely aren't, the universe is as much a part of us as we are parts of it, but our brains and the very way all of our languages work condition us to think of a subject and object, both separate. I see the acorn, the person threw the rock, I hear the bell ringing. There really isn't anything but the ringing itself, and we and the bell being simple observers of it (Yes, that's a Zen koan if you recognized it). It would be very cool to see if you could formulate a language which fundamentally follows this abstraction. Maybe it would allow us to think in different ways, contemplate different futures and concepts.
