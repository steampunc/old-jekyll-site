It's weird to me how we can't instantaneously learn things. I get that people say that if you were just implanted knowledge directly, you wouldn't know necessarily how to use it - that's often the justification in various sci-fi books that I read. Personally, I disagree. I think that if one were just given knowledge without effort, one of the important aspects of that knowledge would be the understanding of how to use it and some common applications. Regardless, I think that this concept of taking time to learn things is actually quite detrimental to people. I know for a fact that I'm quite slow at the uptake of certain concepts, but I've found I'm able to grasp them better when I tell myself that it's possible to learn it much faster.
