Perhaps this is just in California, but I keep seeing license plate patterns. The common (uncustomized) plate has a digit, three characters, then three more digits, taking a form 0AAA000. Although not all license plates follow this pattern, a good many cars do. I'd like to figure out the meaning of the pattern - does that first digit correspond with some sort of datapoint? Is there a method to the seemingly random plates? It would be cool to be able to decipher car owners by their plates.
