I was just working on some code and experienced a Github server outage, which made me think about how stressed those sysadmins and programmers working on it must feel. There's so many companies that rely on their product, and if it goes down then there's serious problems for a lot of groups. Imagine being one of those people, with upwards of a million users using it at a given time relying on you to get the problem fixed as quickly as possible. They do a phenomenal job, so it's rarely for long, but still, trying to quickly diagnose a problem is incredibly stressful - I know from my experience on robotics, and that's just with a few people relying on me, nowhere near as many as Github's services have.
