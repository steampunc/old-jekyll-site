Everything we are around started as an idea, a fantasy. That's incredible. All of these things that we surround ourselves with were at one point fantasies, thoughts that people dreamt up or considered, then put in enough effort to make their fantasy a reality. For every single thing that you touch, provided it's man-made or has been interfered with by man, was a part of an idea. All the weapons that have ever been made, all the medicine that has been used and manufactured, all of these things were due to people's ideas and effort.
