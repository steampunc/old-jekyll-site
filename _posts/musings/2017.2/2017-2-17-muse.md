At certain points, when you're bored out of your mind, time can seem to pass incredibly slowly, but in other instances, an hour can seem like the blink of an eye. I heard about a study where they dropped people from a crane with a screen of quickly flashing numbers, and they were able to read it while falling, even though while simply standing still it was impossible for the test subjects. It's incredible how our brains are able to change their perception of time and such a bummer that I don't have conscious control to do that. Image speeding through a particularly boring meeting or lecture, and being able to slow down your time on a roller coaster or in life threatening situations where you need time to think. Even though you wouldn't be able to move your body as quickly, our minds could still get a lot done.
