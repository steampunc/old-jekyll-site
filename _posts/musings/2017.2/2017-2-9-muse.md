It's interesting how people's personalities often differ, sometimes greatly, between when they are at home or in intimate relationships compared to when they are in public. Understandably, it happens when you've got to talk to someone professionally versus a good friend, but I suppose it simply happens because everyone has different interests, and so when you're with people who share one of your interests but not all, you tend to talk more about that subject.
