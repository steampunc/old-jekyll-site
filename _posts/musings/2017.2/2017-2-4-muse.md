I play the piano and accordion, and it's interesting how we get stuck in ruts of similar muscle memories. Once you learn something incorrectly, it's like your mind defaults to it, and so you keep making that same mistake. It's like we're creating problems for ourselves, when we could easily just work our ways around them if it wasn't a quirk of how our muscles and mind works.
