I've been thinking about truth lately, and I listened to a really interesting podcast about it recently, which has made me come to the conclusion that truth is completely subjective. It doesn't make sense at first, but if you consider the fact that all that we know, all that we can establish must be done within the confines of our own minds. Although I may have written these words at one point, I can't have an absolute certainty that it is saying what I want it to unless it is within my own mind. With this established, and by making multiple drawn-out connections, it seems that whatever you personally believe must be true, at least within the confines of your mind. To get a better and more in-depth understanding of it, you can listen to [this][1]. After I listened to it, I ended up having a good, hour-long discussion with my dad about the subject, and I think based on his reaction to my explanations I didn't get my point across very well. Hopefully the podcast will clear it up.
