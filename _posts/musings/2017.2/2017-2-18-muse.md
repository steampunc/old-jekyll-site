We have so many different words, and a lot of them can be used interchangeably. I know that's not always true, but it's still pretty astonishing how many occurrences it works in. Of course, people do use them to pad their sentences and make them sound smarter, but provided you know the meaning of the words you are using, you can use them to convey further meaning across your sentences than just stating something. Even though, taken literally, a sentence might mean the same thing, the _feeling_ of the sentence can be changes, the emotions that are provoked can change.
