Geometric proofs are so nice, because they really help you get a fundamental understanding of numbers and how they interact. I was absently thinking about squared numbers, when I realized the square of any number is equal to four times the square of half that number. It makes sense algebraically, after all, one half squared is one fourth, and it's quite a simple idea, and I do feel a little silly that the reasoning why didn't come to me as quickly as it should have, but what came to me instead of the algebra was a nice geometric version: Pick a number, like 4.

I'm just realizing that you can use this to find the squares of numbers that you otherwise would have trouble finding! If you know $$7^2$$, you can also find $$3.5^2$$. This is a pretty bad example, but hey, there's a lot more applications.
