Traveling across the causeway between Davis and Sacramento to help my uncle's FRC team troubleshoot problems with their robot, I noticed something pretty cool. It was raining, and as a consequence most cars had their windshield wipers going. I was looking over the freeway into the oncoming traffic and watched all the cars with their wipers, and had the satisfying experience of picking out numerous cars who were in phase, both with my car and some of the other cars on the road.
