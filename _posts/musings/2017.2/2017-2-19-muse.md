Bees are incredibly intricate little creatures. Their wings, so thin, and legs, which are scarcely larger than hairs, are still able to carry around the small little buggers. Not only that, but I was observing some bees in clover this morning and their actions are extremely precise and intricate as well. They can peel apart small bits of the clover flour, an action no human could do with the bee's finesse, and extract pollen. They're really beautiful.
