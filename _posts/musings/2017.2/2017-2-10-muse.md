For the past three years I've been slowly pushing myself harder and harder, and now I've been looking back on how little I would accomplish back in ninth grade and comparing it to now. It's really humbling, to see the progress that I've been making, taking more and more difficult classes and still understanding the materials and doing well in them. What's really interesting to me is that now I could almost _never_ go back to what I would do in ninth grade. It seems like it would have been so easy, and I just can't comprehend how I was having trouble keeping up with what is now to me a minuscule course load. I totally understand that I have definitely made progress, however something in me just questions why I couldn't have immediately gotten to where I am now. I've already written a musing on this, but I've been thinking about it more and more lately.
