We don't have nearly as many nerve ending inside of ourselves as we do on our skin. It's disturbing to think that even though something could hurt while it makes its way inside of you (like a splinter), it won't hurt once it's there. That's why things like internal bleeding and shrapnel injuries are so dangerous - you don't feel them, but they still cause just as many problems as if you felt it. Pain is _not_ a bad thing, it lets us know dangers and the status of our bodies.
