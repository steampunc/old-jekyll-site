Books are incredible. You can pick up a small little object and obtain all of these ideas and mental hallucinations. They've allowed us to spread ideas so much, and store countless generations of though, all at easy access to those who are willing to read it. I suppose this applies to all written language in general, but it's more visible to me with books.
