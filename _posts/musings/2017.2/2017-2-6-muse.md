What allows our brains to get drawn into stories? If you read an engrossing book, or are watching a film, what stops the realization that you are simply looking at a sheet of paper with marks on it, or a sheet of plastic? Once I draw my attention to this, I find it incredibly difficult to return back into the mindset of being drawn into the story, but I've still never been able to pin down what the turning point is. When is the point where you stop realizing that you're looking at a small box, or that you start visualizing the story in your head? Whenever I try and catch that sensation and make myself conscious of it, I then lose it, and I again fail to pin it down. Perhaps one day I'll identify what clicks within people's brains to make them zone into a story, but I don't think I'll be successful alone.
