People form opinions so quickly, it's ridiculous. I feel like first impressions are so much more important that what people chalk it up to be, and so I've been making as much as an effort as possible to minimize my own impressions of people. I know it's probably not possible, but I'll try and make judgments compensating for my first impressions. For sure, first impressions sometimes are good things; you don't want to hire someone who seems to be unkempt or doesn't know what they're talking about, but sometimes, like when peoplewatching, you'll judge a person at a glance. I recently read _Blink_, by Malcom Gladwell, and it's gotten me thinking about these things.
