We're always squabbling over such ephemeral stuff. From large scale conflicts and wars, to small fights within a family, we wage emotional, verbal, and physical battles due to each other's perceived wrongs. The sad thing is, I don't think anyone knows a way around it. Countless people have tried, and all failed, and those who simply say we should settle all of our differences and live in perfect harmony are still unable to. When confronted with terrible wrongdoers like Hitler, _who_ can justify that he should be treated equally? The very idea of equality imposes an order, a hierarchy that some will dislike. Tis a pity.
