What is the judging for sanity? In what justification can you determine any specific thing to be sane, versus insane? For some reason people deem those who talk to themselves, or view the world in a drastically different way as occasionally insane. Although I'm not in any of those cases, I could totally see why people would default to talking to an "imaginary friend," as they are looking for comfort or solace.
