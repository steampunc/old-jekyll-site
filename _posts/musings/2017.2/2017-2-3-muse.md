Blind people are lacking certain things we just take for granted. Ignoring convenience of having vision, there's a lot of aesthetic things that they could never see - Clouds, rolling over a valley, a sunset on the ocean, the branches on trees, all of these things that we inherently take for granted don't exist to them. I'm sure they understand that these things exist, but without having sight to be able to see it, they can't possibly grasp the beauty of some of those things. I'm so sorry for anyone who's blind or has any physical ailment that prevents them from appreciating the world in its entirety.
