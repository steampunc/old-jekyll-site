Where do our thoughts take place? I mean, yeah, it's all part of your brain, but that's the physical location. What I'm talking about is mentally. When you remember something, a place, for example, it doesn't feel like it's in my brain, nor does it feel like it's at the actual place. If I think "Oh, let's imaging San Francisco" then I don't pretend mentally to look over towards the city. It's just _there_. It's like this intermediate location, a separate dimension that doesn't have positions like we think of them. And for things we make up, the location doesn't change. It's also just in that weird, ephemeral dimension of thoughts. Maybe this isn't how everyone situates their thoughts, but it's definitely how it applies to me.
