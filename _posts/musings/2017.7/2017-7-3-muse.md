I was visiting Yosemite, and realized that I will trust some engineer more than I actually trust myself. When some person designed a bridge, we're all trusting that they checked it to make sure that it's safe. It's like a social contract. What's weird is that when I reflected about how I would behave differently if safety precautions like guardrails weren't there, I realized I wouldn't do a lot of the stuff I do. It's like the trust in other people gives us a false sense of security and safety. It is true that a guardrail often makes it a _lot_ safer, but even when I didn't touch the guardrail, I felt safer. The idea of having a safety net, even if you don't need it or use it, still makes us more comfortable with doing dangerous things.
