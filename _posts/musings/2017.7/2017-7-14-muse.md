I've been going on some road trips lately and listening to music, and for some reason the act of being in a car changes my perception of the music and makes me more pensive. I'm not sure why, but I think it's good. It's a way that I can direct my attention and think about meaningful things, and I'd guess that a good deal of any of my realizations come from road trips.
