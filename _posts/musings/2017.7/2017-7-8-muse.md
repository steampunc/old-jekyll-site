I was just made aware of the limits of our perception and how quickly we can see things. I saw one of those finger prickers that is used to extract a drop of blood to check a person's blood sugar, but I could not for the life of me identify the moment when the pricker extended to poke something. It simply moved too fast for me to see it. I had to verify that it worked by poking a piece of paper because I thought that it wasn't extending far enough or something. When I realized it was really that my eyes couldn't see that fast, it makes me wonder what else I might be missing, that moves either too quickly or too slowly for us to notice.
