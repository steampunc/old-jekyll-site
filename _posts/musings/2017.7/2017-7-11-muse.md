She sells see shells by the sea shore. Try typing it. It took me a couple tries to not mix it up. I don't think tongue twisters are limited to our speaking. In writing, I think of the word I'm going to type slightly before I'm about to write it, and then hear it in my head. When I heard that tongue twister, I mixed it up and so I typed it incorrectly. I don't know if it's just me, but it's pretty weird.
