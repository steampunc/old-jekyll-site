It's weird to think that it's impossible that anything we'll ever create is going to create is going to exist indefinitely. However well (or badly) you might do something, at some point it will be forgotten. There will be a point where your name will be spoken for the last time, and it's not as far away as you might think. I'm ashamed to admit that I can't remember my great great grandparents' names, and if I, or one of my cousins or sister don't obtain it, then that point might not be very far away. I don't think it's a bad thing; with every good thing, an end must come, but it's humbling to think that however incredible you might be, you won't stand up to the infinities of time.
