Whoof, I just watched that film. What a powerful message it has. I don't want to ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it (it's hard to avoid the spoiler with all the pop culture on the web, but in case you haven't seen it I'll leave it out), but the ways that it makes you conscious of how lucky we are to have the nature around us is very well executed.
