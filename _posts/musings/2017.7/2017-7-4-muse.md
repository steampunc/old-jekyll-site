In the spirit of the Fourth of July, I noticed something interesting about some of the fireworks. There was a certain type of firework that made a large ring of flares, resulting in what looked like a circle. What was interesting was how frequent they would be well-aligned. You would think that it would be rare for that kind of firework to make a near-perfect circle most of the time, because it could have been rotated up to ninety degrees off from the viewing angle, but it happened fairly infrequently. My theory for why was because someone (evidently a smart fireworks designer) made the launcher shoot them all in a way that made them spin perpendicular to the viewers, so the tendency of the firework was to explode in the correct direction.
