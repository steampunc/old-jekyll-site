I just came upon something on my shelf that I totally forgot about and meant to do for a while! It's a paper airplane kit that has planes you build, not fold. It's called Whitewings, and the planes all look very well-designed and intricate. I'll be making one in the next few days, and coming back with an update on how well it flew, but I have high hopes.
