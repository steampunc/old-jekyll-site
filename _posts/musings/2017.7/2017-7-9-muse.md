While sailing in the SF Bay, I noticed an interesting phenomenon where on the crests of waves in the wind, little droplets of water would catch wind and dance through the air and onto the surface of the water. They were like little jewels, with the sunlight playing off them and skittering off several meters across the water. I wish I caught it on film.
