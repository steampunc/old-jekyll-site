I've been doing a crypto stint lately of messing with writing my own home-brew crypto systems. It's _definitely_ less secure than the tried and true algorithms that exist and have been used by all sorts of corporations, but I'm doing it just for fun, and learning about how all the common large-scale encryption schemes work. All of these one-way functions, hashing, and simple cryptanalysis is super cool, and I've been having a lot of fun messing with it.
