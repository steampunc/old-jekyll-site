This is less of a musing and more of a little thing that doesn't warrant an entire blog post but was a thing I accidentally did just today. I use [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/) and it's really a great password manager. My only snafu is that the commands to initialize a new project and insert a new password are a little bit to similar. For one who uses autocomplete a lot, I tend to accidentally write `pass init` instead of `pass insert` which then changes the public key that encrypts your passwords to nothing, causing all sorts of unhappy errors. The fix (provided you use `gpg`) is to type `gpg -k` and identify your public key that you were previously using. It should be in the form `pub <size of the key>/<public key> <date> <notes>`, and you want to take the public key and then re-write `pass init <public key>`, replacing that with your actual public key. That should fix it and you should then be able to insert more passwords!
