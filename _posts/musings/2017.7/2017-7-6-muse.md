Also in the spirit of visiting Yosemite, like the previous musing from a few days ago, I noticed something else from the rivers and waterfalls there. When the torrents of water from waterfalls flew over the edge, at the top, they're large blobs traveling at high speeds, but by the time that they reach the bottom, they've dissipated into a bunch of small little droplets. This has the interesting affect of decreasing the net velocity of the series of particles. It's because as the particles dissipate, the viscous air affects the smaller droplets, and so as the same net energy from the large globs of water splits up into smaller and smaller globs (the total staying constant), seems to make the droplets slow down.
