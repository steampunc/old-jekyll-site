I've started to realize what I think makes me carsick. It's not so much the windy roads as it is the speckled and rapidly flashing light that permeate the car as it's driving through areas with trees. There does seem to be a correlation between being on small winding roads vs a large freeway and my level of carsickness, but I think that's because there's the flashing lights that are more prominent on small windy roads, while on freeways, shadows seldom reach the majority of the roads. Of course, it's not just the flashing lights that seem to contribute, but I think they, when combined with accelerations that aren't straight down at 9.8 m/s, then I get pushed over the edge sometimes and feel sick.
