I've been working on a project for the blind for a little while, and I'm constantly astonished by the lack of tech support that some start-ups have. I understand that they don't really have the manpower to maintain documentation, but it's still sometimes infuriating when you have to root through moderately badly-written code to try and glean some useful information from their product implementations. It's been bugging me for a while and I guess I just needed to rant a bit. No doubt I contribute to code that other people get infuriated trying to decipher, so I'm being very hypocritical.
