Sometimes our brains will suddenly come up with really irrational fears that even though we know are irrational, we can't help but indulge in. It's weird. Even though I know I live in a safe town in a safe neighborhood and have everyone around me, I'm still worried to go outside to do something like the recycling if it's too late at night.
