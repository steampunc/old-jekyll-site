It worked like a charm, my goodness. It flew for a good ten seconds, and I haven't even tuned it that well yet! I need to get a better rubber band for the catapult that launches it, but other than that, it worked exquisitely. I'm going to be going out and buying myself some cardstock in the coming days to try and design my own. I get the basic principles that go behind designing a paper airplane, and how to strategically place the COM vs COL, but it'll be fun to actually put it to the test outside of a simulator.
