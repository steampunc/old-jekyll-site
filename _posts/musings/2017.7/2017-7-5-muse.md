I was working on some software for encryption, and realized how used to non-user-friendly programs I've gotten, because the interface that I was writing was so bad (command line, not very helpful, difficult to resolve dependencies during installation).
I remember less than two years ago I was confused how to use `apt`, and now that I'm using it on a daily basis, along with other command line tools, I've gotten a lot better at reading obscure man pages.
