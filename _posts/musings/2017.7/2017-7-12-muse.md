I've been watching my little sister's soccer games for a while now, and I can't stop asking myself a question. My sister's team is quite good, it's a club team that I still don't quite understand the intricacies of, but they're still children. My question is: If you somehow gave instantaneous interpersonal communication to this team of younger children, could they beat a pro team? If they had a hive mind, how much of an advantage would it bring them? I'm not really sure, but it has been bouncing around my head for a while now.
