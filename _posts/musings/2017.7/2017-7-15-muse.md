Right in front of my desk in my room is a window, and outside there is a small tree that's been growing for about three years. It's slowly been covering the window and blocking it from the sun that would shine in. The soft rustling of the leaves brushing against the window screen in the breezes is nice and calming. It's nice to be able to look up at any given time as I'm working on things and just leave my train of thought behind as I watch the leaves move. We've got a wonderful world.
