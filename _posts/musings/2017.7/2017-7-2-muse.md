I was looking at my keyboard today and noticed the little black dots that can appear as a by-product of our brains processing our vision strangely. It's called the grid illusion, and it's due to something called lateral inhibition. You can read all about it on Wikipedia, but I've been noticing it more frequently ever since I noticed it on a window.
