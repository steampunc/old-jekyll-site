Our lives are completely uncertain and it's remarkable that we aren't paralyzed by that. There's so much that we don't know, that we can't be sure of, and the fact that we can make any forward-thinking decisions even with this limitation is impressive.

I've been going through the college application process currently, and have been considering the mindset of college educations being necessary. Through a [friend who hasn't gone to college and is doing quite well][http://blog.wesleyac.com/], I know that college is _far_ from being the only path that a person can and should take, but the difficult thing about that decision is how it makes your future so uncertain. With college, at least for the next four years, you can be fairly sure of what you'll be doing, but without, it's up to you.

I don't believe college is necessary, but it's hard to embrace the uncertainty of considering not attending one.
