It's unusual how humans seem to fall into rhythms reflexively, like when someone is playing music, people unconsciously walk with it. I've been unable to stop noticing that for a while now, and it's been driving me crazy how everyone seems to walk to this beat without thinking, driving me to the point of intentionally walking in a different or irregular rhythm whenever I hear music playing because if I walk to the beat it drives myself up the wall with annoyance. I'm sure it seems to other people like something about how I'm walking is ever-so-slightly off when they're following a beat, but to me it feels like everyone else is stuck in some sort of rut without noticing it.
