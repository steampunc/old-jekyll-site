What makes us feel loyalty to each other or to a thing? What compels people to stick with things they find unpleasant? It's strange that so many people seem to do just that. There's something human about how we will forgo personal benefits for others, and I don't think I'd want to meet someone who doesn't share at least some component of that feeling to help others.
