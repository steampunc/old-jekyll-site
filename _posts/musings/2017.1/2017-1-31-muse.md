I was watching _The Prisoner_, an old 1960s television show (which is an absolute masterpiece, I don't watch many shows or television, but this is one incredibly worthy exception), and I started looking into the various people playing parts in the show. One of the characters is the butler, one of the two characters that consistently shows up in most of the episodes, and looking into his life, I found myself overtaken by a profound compassion for him. His name was Angelo Muscat, and he was unnaturally short and played the role of the butler wonderfully. When I read his life story, and heard how he died young, but of natural causes, and how near the end of his life he no longer was acting and was simply fabricating bird cages, alone and poor, I can't help but feel like he deserved so much better than he actually had. I'm not sure where I'm going with this, but now on my bucket list is to find one of his bird cages, and buy it, supporting him and his dream in the only way I know how.
