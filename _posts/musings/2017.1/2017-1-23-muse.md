It's pretty cool how different the branches of trees are. If you look at certain types of trees, their branches are drastically different from the tree's shape, while for other trees it seems that if you cut one of their branches off it looks identical to the tree itself. Compare that to gnarled old branches from a tree, whose branches don't look quite as similar as the tree itself. It's a lot more visible in winter, but even in the summer, you can see which branches look like duplicates of a tree and which don't.
