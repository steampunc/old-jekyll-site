I was walking to school and I noticed that the curbs next to the sidewalk I walk on have actually eroded over time. The very base of the curb-gutter things, where water most frequently flows, is populated with fewer small bits of cement and only the larger rocks that are harder to move still remain. It's strange when I see it, because generally I don't think of man-made objects as things that are subject to erosion. I know it's not true, but for some reason it's easier to think about natural things that have been around for thousands of years eroding over time instead of contemplating the erosion of curbs that have only existed for thirty-some years.
