It's weird how people lose connections that they previously might have had. Think about all the acquaintances that you might still see but don't know well enough to go out of your way to greet. For example, in high school all the people in your classes who you might have sat around and seen in the hallways, but didn't greet or strike up a conversation with. The fact that you knew all these people and you still might see them but don't have the interest in continuing conversations with them. I'm not sure if this makes sense.
