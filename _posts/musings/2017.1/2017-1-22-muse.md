We're really inefficient. I'm continually amazed by the amount of people who don't try and find the most optimal path through something. Ignoring all the mental and digital optimizations that people don't do, in the physical realm something as simple as walking could be better optimized. When someone's walking and there's an obstacle, people don't think about which way might be faster. If while walking they simply considered, "Does this way take fewer steps or does that way?" we could shave easily a half-hour throughout the day of just being more efficient in path finding.
