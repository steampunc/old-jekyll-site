It's weird to think of how many cool things there are that have been photographed, but what's even stranger is how many things that must have not been photographed in comparison to that one photograph. For example:

<center>
<img src="/attachments/pretty.jpg"/>
</center>
This image is very pretty. How many places like this exist that haven't been photographed? It's mind-boggling to think about, that for every photo taken and that is open for the public to see, there must be hundreds of photos, not to mention places that have never been photographed.
