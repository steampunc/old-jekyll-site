On my math tests this year there's a section of true-false questions where you're conceptually tested on your understanding by how you can prove or disprove a true-false question, and I've been learning over time that the two best things to use in your arsenal of proving something's true or false is infinity and zero. Often, when you consider a function or set of numbers that incorporates infinity in some way can break things ([see my blog post on infinite sinusoid compositions][1]).
