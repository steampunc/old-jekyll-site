Intonation really does wonders. It's crazy how much information is transferred subconsciously by the pitch and tone of voice. Much like how a dog can recognize when it's done something wrong without understanding a human language, we can fairly aptly gage moods or a human environment just by listening to the base notes. Like this [site][1], there's some really interesting brain phenomena that occur when you think it's human but it's not, or when you can only hear pitches which change in a human fashion.
