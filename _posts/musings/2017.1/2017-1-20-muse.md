Why can't humans be more precise? We rely so much on these machines to do things that we could never do, but why couldn't we train ourselves to be more precise? It's like we're a badly tuned controller, oscillating around any goal we want to reach. Holding a glass of water, good luck keeping it perfectly level and free of bounces when you're walking somewhere, and there's no hope of keeping water on a flat plate while walking (I've tried). What's keeping us from becoming better (essentially tuning the parameters of our controllers) at doing all of these tasks? I know it's impractical with a lot of precise operations doable by machine, but for general everyday stuff, why can't people be more precise?
