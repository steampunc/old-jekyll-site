I've been refraining from posting on any form of social media because I've been mulling over what I want my first entrance into the world of Twitter and the like should be. I don't want to look back on what I was saying and regret that that was the first thing I ever said on a form of social media. I'm sure that it's inevitable, as people constantly change along with their interests, and so I'll probably even look back on what I'm typing right now and scoff or think to myself "What on earth was I thinking when I wrote that?" which is probably why I'm finding it so difficult. It's so inconsequential, but I've been putting a lot of thought into it lately.
