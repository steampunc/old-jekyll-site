The puddles that appear after rain sometimes are really reflective, and it gives you a glimpse into another world. You can see the sky below you, and trees' branches, which look like roots sticking through the ground and down into the upside-down world. It's like we're actually walking on a shell that has another world inside of itself. What's also cool about the puddles is that due to the index of refraction of water, if you approach them too much they begin to be more see-through and act like glass instead of mirrors, and so you can only see this mirrored world from certain angles, making it elusive.
