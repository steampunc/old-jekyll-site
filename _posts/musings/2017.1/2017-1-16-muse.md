There's a large flood-plain(basin/thingy) near where I live and we've been having a lot of rain, so they've been filling up with water. Normally they're rice flats but with the rain the plain/basin becomes a shallow lake. Since it's not normally full of water, they run things like electrical cables on poles through the fields, which result in a really surreal image when it's full of water. Although I wasn't able to take a picture and my description doesn't do it justice, the vast plain of water stretched off into the distance with a line of cables receding over them, reaching a point too far to see. There was something beautiful about the way the water just covered all of these man-made contraptions, while the line of telephone poles stayed relatively untouched.
