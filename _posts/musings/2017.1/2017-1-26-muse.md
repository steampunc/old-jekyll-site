We never touch anything. It's weird to think about, because the real forces we perceive on our various appendages are actually electric forces, simply electrons repelling each other. The keys I'm pressing aren't actually getting pressed by a contact between my fingers and the keys, it's a repulsion between the electrons as they get close to each other and apply forces based off of Coulomb's law. As cool as it might seem, it makes me feel lonely, that every atom is unfathomable distances from any other atom (on a subatomic scale).
