There was recently a large storm passing through my area and as I was biking somewhere I noticed there were some giant trees that had fallen over. I've always sort of held tree size as an abstract concept in my head, never being fully able to wrap my head around how big most of them are, so I stopped my bike and walked the length of the tree. It was a moderately sized tree at best, but I was still boggled by how tall it was. Actually being able to "climb" the tree horizontally, then visualizing myself at the top of the tree looking down has made me a lot more conscious of how tall and incredibly strong most trees are.
