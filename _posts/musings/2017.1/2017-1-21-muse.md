We pick out patterns in things that really shouldn't have them, or definitely don't have them. For example: when you're in a car listening to music, look outside and take note of how many people are walking to the beat of the music. There's an unusual amount who appear to be walking in rhythm even when they definitely can't hear the music you're listening to. Our brains round the slight difference between the frequency of their steps and the music, resulting in a freaky feeling that everyone is listening to the music you're listening to.
