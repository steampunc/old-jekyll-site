We need light, but it's incredibly immaterial. It's this strange thing that behaves both as a wave and as a particle, and it pervades all of what we do. Unlike other objects and things, you can't wave your hand around and feel it (let's just ignore radiant heat). Even air, you can tell it is there by waving around and creating wind. Light, if you don't have eyes to sense it, is essentially nonexistent.
