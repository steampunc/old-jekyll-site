I was looking into the sky again at dusk, and due to the particularly stormy days we've been having resulting in a lot of clouds, there was a point at which it was difficult to tell what was the clouds and what was the sky, visible past the clouds. They were both near the same shade of brightness, and with them being equally spattered between clouds and sky you couldn't base your observations on which was which by sheer number. I resulted in figuring out which were the clouds and which were the sky by waiting for a few more minutes and observing which things moved and which ones didn't, and using that I was able to deduce the clouds, but prior to that, I had absolutely no idea.
