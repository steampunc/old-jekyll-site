The town I live in is rather small, so you can hear trains passing often, tooting their horns and rumbling along. I've been realizing that based on the clarity of the air the train horns can resonate a lot more or less. Just after rain, you can hear the horns loud and clear, even from a good distance away. Compared to a smoggy day which muffles the sound to the point of barely being able to hear it, there's a definite difference in clarity of the air and how it affects the ability sound has to travel through it.
