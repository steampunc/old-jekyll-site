The frost that covers plants when it's slightly below freezing is amazing. It's like little crystals of glass that are stuck onto all of these intricate leaves, and the sheer fact that it's able to happen so quickly (and dissipate quickly) makes it even more magical feeling. The world doesn't care if you're a large tree or a small blade of grass, it'll give you frost all the same.
