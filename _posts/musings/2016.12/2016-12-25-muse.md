People are all given names. That's just crazy. Every single person you talk to, interact with, or simply glimpse out of the corner of your eye, has been given a name by some other people who have been given names by some other people who have been given names by some other people who have been... It's mind-boggling to think that we've all got these things, that to ourselves are considered incredibly important, but to others is simply a string of sounds. I'm tempted for a day to go out and ask everyone I see for their names, just to get a slightly better idea of the scope of how many people there are out there.
