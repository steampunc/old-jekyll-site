There is a plethora of different music out there. The amount of music itself is impressive, albeit not the most interesting thing (in my opinion). The crazy thing is that for every song that you listen to, the probability is that it took that person at least a few hours to make it. That there's that many people who are willing to dedicate so much of their time to making things that may or may not get ever heard is just amazing. In addition, most people who make music have some sort of understanding of how to make stuff that sounds good. To learn that and to get comfortable using stuff like that is a long endeavor on its own, which is why it's so astonishing that so many people make music.
