Lots of people don't realize how cool dreams are. Every night, you can get transported far away, both from your troubles and to a magical world. You don't even need to go out of your way to enjoy them, because it's very difficult to go without sleep. In addition, you can do whatever you want in them without worry of getting reprimanded, as you're the only one in the dream who can access it!. I'm not one of the people who've been naturally gifted with an ability to lucid dream, but I'm excited to work on developing that aspect of my life, because it'll let me get another hour or two of interesting experiences into my day.
