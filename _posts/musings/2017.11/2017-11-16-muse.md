I was experimenting with Google's automatic calendar date recognition in e-mails, and noticed something interesting. We've been designing computers to get better and better at extracting information from naturally-written text, like the sentence "I'll be hosting a party on Thursday at 5:00pm" but because we're now focusing so much on natural text, their algorithm overlooks formatted dates. Natural language processing is super cool, and it's working better and better the more time and effort people invest into improving it, but it really struck me how specialized a lot of programs currently are. If you write a program to recognize dates from natural language, then it won't be very good at finding them in structured tables. Eventually, we'll be seeing programs that are as versatile as humans are, if not more, and it'll be interesting to see the evolution of flexible programs. Already there's things like neural networks that can now interpret things much more diversely than programs could ten years ago, but they're still function specific. One day though, that'll change, and I hope I'll be around for it.
