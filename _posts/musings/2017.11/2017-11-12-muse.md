It's likely, in my later years, that I'll fall into denial about the ever-progressing limitations of age. By the time I'm 90, I doubt I'll be climbing a tree with the same ease that I currently do, or learning how to ride a hoverboard, and there's not going to be much I'll be able to do to fix that. Our minds will fall into disrepair, with mental issues, along with physical, and we won't be able to counteract it (unless science does some cool stuff, like they have in the past). I'm not sure where I'm going with this, but I guess I'll end this with the remark that we should do all that we can in the time that we have.
