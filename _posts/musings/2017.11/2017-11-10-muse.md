I learned to ride a unicycle today! Took me about three hours of consolidated work, but at the end of it, I'm finding myself now able to go down my street and back. It really struck me how much we are able to adapt as autonomous agents trying to accomplish things. There's always limits to what you can to, but with enough work we can push those limits. The pushing itself doesn't always come easily, but I firmly believe that provided you spend enough time and effort on something, you'll gain proficiency in it, or start getting better.

Of course, I'm ignoring that we're limited by our own bodies, and there are some things that I guess we'll never do. However, for things that we can't do just because our minds aren't used to it, or because we haven't built up the understanding to get something done, discipline and time is the best way to get better.
