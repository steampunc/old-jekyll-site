Cars are very loud; I was walking home the other day and realize how silent it was. It took me a moment to understand that it was because there weren't any cars traveling down the street. We get so used to their noise, so when it got quiet enough to hear my footsteps and breathing, I had to take a moment to recognize what was different.
