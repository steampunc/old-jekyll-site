In my math class right now, we're looking at bijective functions and one interesting example of one that I saw was:

What I find interesting about this function is that not only does it map a two-dimensional set of natural numbers to a single value, but it does so in a one to one and onto fashion, meaning it's bijective. This means that for any number k in the natural numbers, there exists exactly one value of n and m such that that the function will equal that number k. Now, this serves as a proof for the cardinality of numbers, but I was thinking about something else.

You're taking two values and condensing them into a single value. For a moment (I realized this while it was late and I was tired, so I didn't see the flaws in it), I felt this exhilarating feeling that I could compress things infinitely and I had discovered something that no one had thought of! Of course, I now see the problem (the two values that you're giving the function result in a larger value as an output, one that takes up just as much space as the other two values did), and I'm sure someone else fell through the same pitfalls that I did, but I felt really good for a moment due to a simple mistake. I guess it's true that sometimes ignorance is bliss.
