I need to add Google Analytics to my website. At this moment, I have no idea how many people are reading this right now... It's possible that there's little-to-no-one reading things aside from people I know who happen to be checking out what I'm doing, or there could be hundreds of anonymous people traversing the site every day. I have no idea, and in the back of my mind, I write these things as if it's in a vacuum, with very few people reading it. In all likelyhood, that's true, but until I get some sort of site analytics stuff running, I have no idea. It'll be interesting to see later.
