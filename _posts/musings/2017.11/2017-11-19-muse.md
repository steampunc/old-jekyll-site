I've been interacting with various forms of social media lately, and I'm really interested by the following recommendations that it gives me. There's a very small amount of people whom I follow, but it manages to identify pretty much everyone I interact with frequently, and seems to be finding all the members of my school year, even those I've never even spoken to (we have a fairly large senior class). I guess it makes sense, because the majority of people only know and make friends with people related to them through some common activity like being in the same school, so the network of connections is relatively limited to that environment, but it seems remarkable to me.
