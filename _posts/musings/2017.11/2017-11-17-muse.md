I've been studying for a math test and one of the things on it is the idea of proofs by induction. It makes complete sense, that if you can prove that the following number shares the same property, and that if you establish an initial number then it will map to all numbers from that initial natural number to infinity, but what I can't believe is that there's no proof that induction works. We assume induction to be an axiom, because if you can't use it, a _lot_ of things aren't provable.
