I don't actually know how this would work, but I think it would look awesome. Imagine all the clouds in the sky were reflective, to an almost polished/metallic extent! You could look up and see the world around you, and really get a scale for the size of the sky and the height at which clouds are above us. When you look off into the distance on a cloudy day, imagine seeing the world reflected down from above you, stretching off into the distance.

Of course, it probably wouldn't work like that, considering clouds aren't coherent masses, so the reflections would be all distorted, but that doesn't mean I can't imagine it!
