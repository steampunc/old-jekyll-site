I think many people use those blue-light filters for their devices when it gets later at night, and I'm no exception. I noticed today that if you tilt many displays (or at least a 2010 MacBook Pro's and my Viewsonic monitor, I noticed this doesn't occur on phones as much), you get a much oranger shade looking at it from below, and, if anything, a much more blue shade from the an upper angle relative to the display. It must be some artifact of the polarizing filter(?) or perhaps some other part of screens that causes them to have these properties.
