Language is weird. I learned from my friend Kyle, who is currently studying French, that I've been using an expression incorrectly my entire life. I grew up speaking French with my mother and sister, but not many other people, so there's a lot of idiosyncrasies that are specific to our "dialect", and since we didn't have a large group of people with whom to talk to, a lot of things have gone unnoticed. For the most part it's the same, but when I listen to French, I find myself occasionally thinking about how certain aspects of my speech are different than that of a speaker who wasn't as linguistically isolated. We have certain words that aren't actually French, but we understand them and use them as if they were. It all depends on how you define a language I guess.
