Moral relativism in general seems like it's a cop-out solution for actually dealing with moral quandaries, or at least, I think it's that way. It's hard for me to contemplate other value systems other than the ones I've been raised in, and although I try to keep an open mind and understand others' points of view, it seems like there's got to be stuff that's fundamentally wrong in all value systems.
I know there's always people who don't follow the same ideals, but I can't see how people justify any of the absolutely terrible things human beings can do to one another, or to other animals, for that matter. By saying "everything's relative" we're treating these terrible things that people do as irregularities, not as problems that could be fixed. It's important to allow freedom of thought and expression, but _I_ feel that there's some point where you must draw the line.
