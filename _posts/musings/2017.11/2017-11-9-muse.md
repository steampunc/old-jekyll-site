I wonder if the implied rules that we have for eye contact between people arose from some more fundamental reflex or need. Eye contact has been historically used to show aggressive intent within animals, and so it's weird that us humans see it as almost the opposite (aside from that unsettling staring that occasionally we come across). We also have [a tendency to answer more questions correctly when we avoid eye contact/avert our eyes][1], and I wonder if there's some correlation between an unconscious threat and the inhibition of our lucidity within our minds.
