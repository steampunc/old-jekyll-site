I get to do the dishes at my house, and I noticed something strange. It seems like the plastics (tupperware and odd objects) don't dry nearly as effectively as the metal or ceramic dishes when using a dishwasher. I'm thankful we have one - I wouldn't want to do all the dishes without it - but it's interesting that plastics retain the moisture more strongly than the other dishes. I would guess that it's because of heat(?) that doesn't get transferred as easily (on second thought this doesn't make sense because ceramics are insulators). Maybe it's in fact due to the attraction of water to plastic vs glass; it's more strongly attracted to the plastic. I'm not sure, I guess I should do some more research on the subject.
