In the next few weeks I'm going to be doing a lot of traveling, and as a byproduct of that, I'm starting to get astonished by the prices of plane tickets. Some of them are ridiculously expensive, but others seem awfully cheap for what they promise. I ran some numbers on international flights from SFO (San Fransico) to LGW (London Gatwick), and for some of the flights the price is actually _under_ a dollar a minute.
