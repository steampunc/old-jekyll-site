I observed a pretty cool diffraction of water waves today. There were waves coming towards me, which hit a small outcropping of rock jutting out from the water, then turned about ninety degrees _very_ quickly. Writing it down now, it doesn't seem that unusual, but I assure you that when I was observing it, the coolness-factor was much more elevated.
