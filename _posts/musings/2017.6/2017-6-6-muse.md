  My physics class is quite possibly my favorite place on earth currently, and we're studing the very interesting topic of relativity (side note, from what I've heard Einstein wanted it to be called the theory of constantivity, not relativity because the more important premise outlined in his two postulates was that the speed of light was constant regardless of the observer). What's strange to me is how simultaneity is completely relative, and that even though you see two people clapping in sync, another person moving sees it as one person clapping before the other, even ignoring the delay for light to travel to the new observer. In their actual frame of reference, the two people seem to be clapping slightly off.
