It's interesting how water pours. When it comes out of a spout, it sort-of flip-flops, looking like a fluid chain. I assume this oscillatory motion is due to the surface tension of the water causing it to try and form a ball, but since it overshoots, it oscillates. What's cool is how it seems to find a fundamental frequency or partial wave that lets it seem like it's just hanging there.

See the little bulges in the water? This was the best stock photo I could find, but I'm sure there's been studies done on it and a whole bunch of better photos that I couldn't be bothered to look up.
