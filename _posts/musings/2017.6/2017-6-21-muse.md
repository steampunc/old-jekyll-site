I think my time in isolation has actually helped me really understand the scale of the solar system, because I've now gotten a much better understanding for the length of a day. When you think about the size of the solar system, it's sort of hard to wrap your head around it. However, what I've now found really helped was considering the length of the day, and the speed of the Earth. Right now, the Earth is hurtling along at 67,000 miles per hour, and even at that exorbitant speed it still takes three hundred and sixty five of these incredibly long units of time to make it all the way around the Sun in our orbit. Now, this only works if you do actually have a good sense of how long a day is and I still don't think I have a perfect one, but it's definitely gotten better.
