Tomorrow I'm going to be entering solitary confinement for roughly a week, and I think it's going to be very interesting. I know this isn't like one of my common musings, but the next week's worth of musings will have been written by me in solitary for the week. Have fun reading them, and ahead of time, I'm going to guess that I'll _really_ miss human contact and being able to look out of windows and see the sky by the time I get out.
