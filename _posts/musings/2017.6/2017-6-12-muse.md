What on _earth_ makes thunder roll? If it's produced by lightning, which to my understanding is rather fast and short-lived, why can thunder hang around for multiple seconds? My only guess/answer is that the sound from the top of the lightning takes more time to travel to you than the bottom, so although it's simultaneously happening, there's a signal delay between hearing the bottom of the thunder and the top. I have absolutely no idea, and I'll look it up as soon as I can. That was written by me during isolation, and it turns out I was right! That's pretty interesting, and a really good visualization for the speed of sound.
