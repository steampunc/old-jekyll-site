School got out today, and as I was walking home (when most of my contemplation occurs, a trend which is probably evident by looking at previous musings), savoring my final walk until I either walk to the school for some undetermined reason, or classes start again next fall, I realized how much significance we give to completely insignificant things. Yes, it might have been my last walk as a junior in high school, but what really distinguishes it from any other walk? I'm still walking home, I'm still taking five and a half minutes to do it, the same cars picking up the same kids from school are driving by, there really isn't that much of a difference from any other walk that I've taken, other than the fact that the weather might be slightly different and that I won't be making the same walk for a few months. This idea of assigning values is the same with sentimental objects. Yeah, I did get that world championship medal from having won FRC champs in 2015 with my robotics team, but why do I need the medal? I have the memory, and the ideas that came about from it. I might start clearing out some extraneous things, or digitizing them more, if I stay in this mindset, but I've yet to think about it enough for me to feel comfortable committing to it.
