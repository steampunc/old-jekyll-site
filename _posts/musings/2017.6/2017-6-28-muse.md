The difficult part of meditation is clearing your mind, living only in the moment. I try to do that generally in my everyday life (to little avail) but occasionally I'll sit down and just _try_ to meditate. It's funny to me that when I eventually succeed in clearing my mind, focusing on breathing, I'll realize that I succeeded, then at that moment, I'll have gone out of that mode of world-awareness. It's a paradox, and I really need to stop recognizing it. I also need to change my attitude in entering meditation because I'm setting a goal (that's a thing for another time though)
