We were driving up into the mountains this week, and I brought with myself some tinted sunglasses. Normally I don't wear sunglasses, and so I noticed something weird. Since our eyes (and brains!) are used to seeing the world through a certain color palette, looking at it through a different lens or color will make things you don't typically notice pop out at you. For example, there were scatterings of dead pine trees by the side of the road. My eyes normally just pass over them, but when wearing the tinted lenses which make everything more red, they really stood out and I kept noticing clumps of trees. If you're having trouble seeing something, try changing _how_ you see it.
