I noticed something really funny today. We have some sliding glass windows looking out into our backyard, and I was sitting at a table and kept hearing little thunks. It turns out it was bees flying into the windows. Now, that in in of itself isn't particularly funny, think about the poor bees, not seeing the windows and potentially injuring themselves. What _is_ funny, or at least mildly interesting, is the markings they left. The ones carrying pollen had a significant amount of pollen which would fall off from itself, leaving little dots of pollen.
