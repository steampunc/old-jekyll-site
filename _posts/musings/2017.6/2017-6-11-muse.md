Why do things other than quality make a brand popular? I recently bought a cheap pair of noise-canceling bluetooth headphones from an off-brand company for sixty bucks, and they're really phenomenal! Comparing them to a friend's three hundred dollar Sony pair, there really isn't that much difference in sound quality or cancellation, so what makes Sony or Beats such a well-known brand, and not Cowin, the company selling my headphones? I wonder how many wonderful products we've completely missed because it lacked popularity or was shut down by a lower-quality product from a well-known company.
