I've been humming songs and tapping them out with my fingers lately, and I'm noticing that unless I do it out loud, I "hear" minor songs in a major key. If I want to "hear" it in minor, like it's supposed to be, it takes a _lot_ of coordinated effort. I'm not sure why that is, but it's sorta weird.
