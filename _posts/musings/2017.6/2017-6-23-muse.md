I really enjoy _not_ following the instructions on assembly manuals, trying to figure out how to assemble things myself. Even though it sometimes doesn't work out, and I end up needing to take apart the entire thing and re-build it correctly, it's helped me a lot with spacial awareness and thinking about mechanical things. If you haven't tried it, it's really fun and works like those assembly puzzles.
