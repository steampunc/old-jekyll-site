I was up in the mountains earlier this week and saw this very interesting phenomenon that occurred when light refracted through a thin and variable sheet of water. Since it was flowing over a rock, the sudden fluctuations of the thickness and angle that we were seeing the rock through made it "breathe", appearing to pulse with a slight rhythm.
