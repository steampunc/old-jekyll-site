Isn't it strange how we don't have complete control of our thoughts? I mean, yeah, if you want to think about something, directing your thoughts, then you can do that, but if I place an image or thought into your head, you are powerless to stop it (unless you stop reading or are incredible at controlling your thoughts. If you can control your thoughts to that extent, then send me a message! I'd love to meet you).
