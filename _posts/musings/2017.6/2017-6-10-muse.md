In 10th grade, there was a Kazakhstanian foreign exchange student who I became friends with. We would do stuff together during the classes we shared, and I would make an effort to help him with his English (Which got decidedly better). At the end of the year, I didn't realize he was returning to Kazakhstan but we had exchanged e-mails, so I was still able to contact him. I'm not really sure where this is going, but what I've taken away from this story/chain of events is that you should value the friends you have, because you never know if they will always be around.
