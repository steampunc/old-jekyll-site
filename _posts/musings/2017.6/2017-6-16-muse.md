You can't just be with yourself. I'm coming to realize that as my solitary confinement experiment/adventure is coming to a close. As much as you might be able to do, however smart or creative you may be, you _need_ people, others with which you can have conversations with, or just to escape the moment. I definitely disagree that simple time with oneself is bad, but having experienced it for a solid week, it is not all you need. There's a lot more to being a human being that just yourself.
