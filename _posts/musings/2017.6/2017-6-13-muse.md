I was watching a vial of soap today and flipping it upside-down, and I'm noticing the interesting phenomenon of the smaller bubbles floating much more slowly to the surface. The larger the bubble, the faster it moves towards the surface. It's a very nice visual for buoyancy, and how the greater volume displaced, the greater the buoyant force. Since air really doesn't have significant density in comparison to the soap, the main determining factor for the bubble velocity is the volume, not a combination of the two substances densities and volume. Physics is so cool.
