I've been reflecting on a recent trip to an indoor skydiving place, and wow, was it an incredible experience. It's perhaps one of the few times in my entire life that I will be able to go for one minute without touching the ground or anything but air. Not only that, but the feeling that you feel while gliding around in the torrents of air is really extraordinary. It's a must-do for anyone who's interested in skydiving, or just for anyone in general.
