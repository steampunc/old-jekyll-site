You don't realize how _long_ a day is. I'm sure you think you do, but I don't think anyone actually understands it, including myself. It's an incredible amount of time, and yet as you do things it seems to go by so quickly. One way to get a better approximation of how truly extensive each and every day is is to dedicate one or more days to doing _nothing_. Just letting the time tick by, as you twiddle your thumbs, waiting for it to be over. With all of us in our busy day-to-day lives, it might seem unthinkable, but you should try it!
