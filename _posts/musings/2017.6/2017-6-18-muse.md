I was going on a bike ride this morning and realized that we really don't touch the earth all that much. We're either touching it through shoes, or some other man-made object. It's rare when you actually are touching the ground. For something we spend so much time on, I thought that was sort of weird, and resolved to walk through the grass barefoot once I got home. I think we're definitely distancing ourselves from the natural world to much, and I'll do my best to mitigate that.
