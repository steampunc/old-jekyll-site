I already posted a musing on this earlier, but I was walking home today and it was strangely sprinkling, something incredibly uncommon for near-summer Davis, and while doing so, I spotted those strange little bubbles of water that form on top of the surface of water as well. What's also interesting, and these dots got me thinking about it, is how incredibly frequent rain falls. You can barely look anywhere that doesn't have a drop of rain hitting the ground within the next few seconds, and the dots served as markers which stayed around marking the drops' landings for a while after landing. This made the frequency of rain fall really stick out to me more than normal.
