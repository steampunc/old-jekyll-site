We look back on ourselves and often cringe at our past actions. "Oh my goodness, that was so embarrassing, I can't believe I did that." I am starting to think that this cringe is caused by our moral development, in the sense that the person you currently are operates with a different world view than you used to. Say you're currently sociocentric, then your pre-sociocentric behavior will seem strange to you. I think this gradual dissociation, shift in personality and morality is the leading cause of this "cringe" that we experience.
