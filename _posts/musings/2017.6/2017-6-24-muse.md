I've always been mesmerized by paper airplanes, and recently I've been folding a lot of them. It's so cool that you can take a piece of paper and make it stay in the air simply by folding it, and just holding competitions with other people to try and make one that flies the furthest or stays in the air the longest is a load of fun.
