It's not uncommon to find shards of glass on a beach which have been rounded and smoothed by the rhythmic beating of the waves and collisions with rocks, but it's rare that you find that kind of thing in other environments. That's why I found it strange when I found a small piece of bike reflector plastic on my walk to school that had been ground away over time and turned smooth like a piece of ocean glass. It's quite pretty.
