I was doing my homework (school's started again) when I was called out by my little sister to look at how she could hold bubbles. Evidently I did, but what struck me as interesting was how when we were inflating bubbles through straws, the bubbles began rotating. Presumably that was because of the blowing on the edge of the bubble, but it was a cool little detail that I might have overlooked had I not been looking out for it.
