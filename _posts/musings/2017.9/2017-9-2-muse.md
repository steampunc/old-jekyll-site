I'd really like to learn how to fly a plane as a hobby. Not only does it get you a much better sense of scale for clouds, but it also opens the opportunity to witness the best sunsets I've ever seen. I was flying into LA yesterday, and it was absolutely incredible seeing the sun set while we were landing. It reflected off of all the lakes, and through the clouds, and just generally made it look incredible.
