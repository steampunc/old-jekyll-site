The school year has just about started, and I don't know how to feel. I'm glad this summer was a productive one, and I did a lot, but I'm also excited to take some classes again. It's strange that this is my last year of high school; I feel so old, even though I'm incredibly young in comparison to how much of my life there is ahead of me.
