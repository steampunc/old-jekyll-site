We don't look up nearly enough. I've walked to and from school for the past three years, and it was only now that I happened to look up in a particular stretch of sidewalk. An area that I always considered fairly covered with tree limbs and branches (lower and nearer to my eyes), when looking straight up, was in fact very sparse. I know it seems small, but next time you're walking somewhere you're used to walking, take a moment and _actually_ look up.
