The only thing preventing you from doing something that's self-motivated and relies solely on yourself is you. We are our own roadblocks in so many cases and even though there's many physical limits and political limits and all sorts of limits, the best way to change yourself is probably to find those roadblocks in your own actions and remove them. In the same line of thinking as Jocko Willink, discipline is one of the key ways to changing things in your life, and it's good to acknowledge that sometimes.
