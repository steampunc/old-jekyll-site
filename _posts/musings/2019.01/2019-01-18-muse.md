This week I learned about BlackRock and their Aladdin program. It's remarkable to me that I had never heard about their (rather successful, but not foolproof) attempt to make the world more deterministic and predictable. They manage an extensive amount of wealth in the world (something like 7%) and yet somehow it seems to not be known much outside of financial circles. You can read a lot more about them on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackRock).
