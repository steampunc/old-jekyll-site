With the recent dynamic weather, many of the mornings lately have been foggy, and it's fun to see how contrary to rain, fog actually wets the spaces below the trees before getting anywhere else. It's because the droplets are condensing and forming more readily when there's a surface, like a tree branch, to adhere to, and so in particularily dense fog, it's almost like the trees are raining.
