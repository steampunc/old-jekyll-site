There's been some pretty nice weather in Davis lately (rainy and varied clouds), and I was walking home from school with some pretty heavy rain, lacking a rain jacket. I noticed that every person that I passed would grin at me, as would I to them. It's like somehow the sudden downpour brought all the people out of their shells, making them interact with eachother (or at least just me) a lot more than most other pedestrians do. It felt nice to share some sort of experience like that with total strangers; I was smiling to myself for a little while after getting home.
