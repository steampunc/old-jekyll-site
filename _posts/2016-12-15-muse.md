Walking home from robotics, I've been noticing that certain streetlights project different shadows. There's one on my way back from robotics that has trees blocking it, and the little light that shines through the trees (which were glistening with raindrops today as I was passing by) is shaped in these strange grids. Compare that to a street light a few houses down, which presumably is using a different type of bulb - it casts nice round shadows. For some reason this caught my attention, and I'm not really sure of its significance. It's just pretty looking.
