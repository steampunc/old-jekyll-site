Cars are weird. I get that a lot of very smart people have worked very hard on making them efficient, but some things are overlooked. Why do they have to be individual property? If every neighborhood or group of houses coordinated to own cars and borrow/lend them to other groups if there's a surplus or decrease in demand of cars, we could both reduce the amount of cars owned by people, along with increasing connections with people near you by interacting and collaborating to figure out car-sharing.
