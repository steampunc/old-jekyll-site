This was the first real song I made that wasn't a random improvisation or only had one instrument. The soundcloud link doesn't really do it justice because it reduced the quality of the audio a lot, so the overtones and weird artifacts that I was hearing and felt like it added a lot to the song isn't really there. Thankfully, the download link on soundcloud still provides the full quality audio recording, it's just that it transcodes the audio to a 128 kbps mp3 for the player, so if you're interested in hearing the better quality version, download it!

Muscat is a song in honor of Angelo Muscat, most commonly remembered as the butler from the 1969 television show _The Prisoner_. After finishing the show, I looked him up because I was intrigued to see what else Muscat had done, and was struck with a sudden pang of sadness to see that despite all his aspirations and hopes to be an actor, his only major role was that of the butler. Before his early death at 47, he worked making ornate birdcages, and died alone. I was really affected by his story, so I wanted to make a song commemorating him.

I really like the percussion in this song. I'm pretty bad at creating drum beats, so none of them are particularily creative, but the usage of a typewriter for the beats worked well with the other instruments in the song.

I've been listening and reading a lot of psychological material lately. I heard C. G. Jung in a documentary, and in addition to liking his theories and work, he speaks in an interesting meter that I wanted to put in a song. There's not much interesting music to this song, but Jung's story is intriguing.

Mr. Richardson was my physics teacher for two years, and I found his class one of the most engaging and positive experiences I've had in school (not that I have had bad experiences in other classes). I wanted to make something to thank him. His form of teaching worked really well for me - using lectures that I'm sure he's refined for the last twenty years to the point that whatever concept he's trying to demonstrate just makes sense, and also giving students as many opportunities to exercise our understanding through warm-ups that really make us think. His class was wonderful, and I really want to thank him for the experience I had in his class.
