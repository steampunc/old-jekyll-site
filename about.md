I'm Finn. I do things and if they're interesting enough or easily digitizeable, I put it on this website. I was programmer on the high school robotics team <a href="http://citruscircuits.org">Citrus Circuits</a> for three years, and now I'm "working" freelance, doing my own projects and experimenting. I play piano and compose music, which you can see on <a href="http://youtube.com/steampunc" target="_blank">youtube</a> and <a href="http://soundcloud.com/steampunc" target="_blank">soundcloud</a> respectively.
